### GITHUB_TOKEN

To obtain a personal access token for GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click on your profile avatar in the top right corner and select "Settings".
3. In the side menu, choose "Developer settings", then "Personal access tokens", and finally "Fine-grained tokens".
4. Click on the "Generate new token" button.
5. Select the necessary access rights for your token. Please note that the more permissions you grant, the more capabilities your token will have, so choose only the permissions that are truly necessary for your project. After selecting permissions, click on the "Generate token" button.
6. Copy the generated token to a secure location as it will not be displayed again after you leave the page.

Remember that the token grants access to your GitHub account, so be cautious and do not share it with third parties. It is also advisable to regularly check and update tokens if they are no longer needed or if you suspect they may have been compromised.
